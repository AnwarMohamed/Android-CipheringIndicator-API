>Ideally, I'm hoping for someone who can identify the areas where Android >needs to change, put together a small proposal / writeup with sufficient >technical information that I can have it reviewed by our telecom engineers >here, and then do the implementation of the changes.

>All of our code is in the Android open source project, so a lot of >documents, like how to build Android, are already available. I believe it's >a simple matter of plumbing the cipher mode from the underlying code to an >application accessible API, but I could be wrong.

>So far, there's really no other information about this feature, other than >what's in the bug. I would suggest using the bug to collect the information.
